## **DS â€“ Netflix Data Cleaning & Aggregation**

The Netflix dataset, consisting of movies and TV shows, presents a rich source of information for data analysis. However, to extract meaningful insights, the dataset must first undergo thorough cleaning and transformation. The raw data contains inconsistencies, missing values, and unstructured information, making it unsuitable for immediate analysis. This project focuses on transforming the dataset into a clean, structured format that is easy to work with for further analysis, reporting, and dashboard creation.

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to apply data cleaning and transformation techniques using Python libraries such as pandas and NumPy. By executing these tasks, the dataset will be prepared for advanced analytical processes and visual representation. The final output will be a refined dataset, ready for reporting, generating actionable insights, and creating dashboards that showcase trends and patterns within the Netflix content.

**Problem Statement:**

The current state of the Netflix dataset, with its missing values, redundant columns, and unstructured data, makes it challenging to perform in-depth analysis. Without proper data cleaning and transformation, generating accurate insights and building a reliable dashboard is not feasible. Therefore, this project aims to address these issues by cleaning and structuring the dataset, ensuring that it is ready for in-depth analysis and reporting.
